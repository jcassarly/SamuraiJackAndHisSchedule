\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
$<$Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this
document, including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the
product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only
part of the system or a single subsystem.$>$

\section{Project Scope}
$<$Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose,
including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to
corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document
is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.$>$

\section{References}
$<$List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may
include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements
specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide
enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference,
including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.$>$


\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
$<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product
family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained
product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the
requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and
identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major
components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external
interfaces can be helpful.$>$

\section{Product Functions}
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
$<$Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product.
User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product
functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational
level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.
Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the
most important user classes for this product from those who are less important
to satisfy.$>$

\section{Operating Environment}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ p{1cm} p{14cm} }
OE-1: & The GBUS application shall operate on the following platforms: Google Chrome version 72, Android version 7, iPhone versions 7, 8, and X. \\
OE-2: & The GBUS application shall store all user account data on a server running the latest Debian Linux and Apache WebServer. \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2cm} p{13cm} }
CO-1: & All JavaScript code shall conform to the Airbnb Javascript Style Guide \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{User Documentation}
$<$List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help,
and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any
known user documentation delivery formats or standards.$>$
\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

$<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial
components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating
environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions
are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the
project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to
reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
$<$Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software
product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards
or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout
constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on
every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on.
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of
the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface
specification.$>$

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
$<$Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between
the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include
the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions
between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be
used.$>$

\section{Software Interfaces}
$<$Describe the connections between this product and other specific software
components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools,
libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or
messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each.
Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to
documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols.
Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data
sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a
global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an
implementation constraint.$>$

\section{Communications Interfaces}
$<$Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions
required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server
communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent
message formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such
as FTP or HTTP. Specify any communication security or encryption issues, data
transfer rates, and synchronization mechanisms.$>$


\chapter{System Features}
$<$This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the
product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may
prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class,
object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the
most logical sense for your product.$>$

\section{General Settings}

\subsection{Description and Priority}
The General Settings menu of the application provides the user with options that allows them to customize their experience. All changes made in the menu will automatically save and sync with the server. Priority = Medium.

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2cm} p{13cm} }
Stimulus: & The user opens the General Settings menu. \\
Response: & All of the available options to customize are listed to the user with entry forms. \\
\\
Stimulus: & The user enters a new default value into one of the entry forms in the General Settings menu. \\
Response: & The value used by the feature they are changing the setting for is updated within the application. The change is only used for future actions by the user.  No changes are automatically made to existing events. \\
\\
Stimulus: & The user attempts to enter a new value minimum or maximum event time value that does not fall into the proper constraints for the value. \\
Response: & The user is presented with an error and the application requests that they change the value to something valid.  No changes to the default used by the application are used and the changes the user made are not saved if they leave the menu and come back. \\
\\
Stimulus: & The user chooses to change their email or reset their password. \\
Response: & The application displays two new text fields under the selected option where the user enters their new email or password and then re-enters the same email or password.  Assuming both fields have matching text, the application updates the account with the new information on the server. \\
