\chapter{User Interface}

this section describes UI

\section{Home Screen}

The Home Screen will be the default page for the application.  It will display the current date, Toolbar, and a view of the user's calendar of events if logged in.  If the user is not logged in, the calendar will be empty. See Figure 2 for a skeleton of the Home Screen.

The Home Screen will also have a Hamburger Menu where the user can access their account information and the General Settings.  See Figure 3 for a skeleton of the Hamburger menu.

In regards to account information, the user will be able to bring up fields to change their account email and password.  Additionally, the user will be able to bring up login, logout, and registration menus from the Hamburger Menu.

\section{Event Editing and Creation Menu}

When the user wants to create an event, they will be able to click the Create event on the Toolbar.  When they do so, they will be presented with a choice of creating a Standard, Location, or Deadline event (from a drop down menu). Once the user makes their decision, a form with the necessary items to create an event will be displayed.  All of the items will have default values filled in based on the General Settings or global defaults.
\\\\
Additionally, the same form can be pulled up from any existing event by clicking on  it.  All the default values in the form will be the values stored in the chosen Event object.
\\\\
The form the user sees will have a skeleton matching figure 1 where each field follows the format specified by \textit{UI Patterns}.
\\\\
Once the user finishes filling in the form, they can either save the form and go back to the Home Screen or discard the changes and return to the Home Screen.
\\
One exception to the aforementioned exiting process is with Deadline events.  Once the user clicks save on a Deadline event, they will be presented with a diff between their old calendar and the changes the auto scheduler proposes based on the information provided for the deadline event.  The user will be given the option to accept the changes or reject them (returning them to the input form).  Upon acceptance, the changes are saved and the user goes back to the home screen.
\\\\
The following diagram shows the flow of this editing/creation process.

\subsection{Standard Event Input Fields}
The following table describes the input fields shown to the user for a Standard Event
\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{ | p{3cm} | p{8cm} | p{4cm} | }
\hline
\textbf{Field Name} & \textbf{Field Type} & \textbf{Default Value for Creation} \\
\hline

\hline

\hline

\hline

\hline
Locked & Checkbox & True \\
\hline
\end{longtable}
\end{center}

\subsection{Location Event Input Fields}
The Location event will have have the same input fields as the Standard event except without the Locked field

\subsection{Deadline Event Input Fields}
The following table describes the input fields shown to the user for a Deadline Event

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{ | p{3cm} | p{8cm} | p{4cm} | }
\hline
\textbf{Field Name} & \textbf{Field Type} & \textbf{Default Value for Creation} \\
\hline

\hline

\hline
\end{longtable}
\end{center}

\section{General Settings Menu}

The General Settings Menu will be accessible from the Hamburger Menu on the home screen.  When the user enters the General Settings Menu, the application will look up the settings and load them into a series of input fields they they can edit.  When the user saves their changes to the form, they will return to the Home Screen.  If the user clicks the back button without saving, they will be prompted with a pop-up that checks to make sure they really want to leave without saving.  If they say yes, their changes will not be saved and they will go back to the Home Screen.  Otherwise, they will not leave the General Settings and can continue editing.
\\\\
The following state diagram depicts the above process:
\\\\
$<$$<$Insert PUML Diagram$>$$>$
\\\\
The UI will utilize the skeleton depicted in Figure 1 where each field follows the format specified by \textit{UI Patterns}.
\\\\
The information on this page will include all items specified in the General Settings Requirements.  The following table describes the Input Fields in more detail:

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{ | p{3cm} | p{6cm} | p{6cm} | }
\hline
\textbf{Field Name} & \textbf{Field Type} & \textbf{Default from Requirements} \\
\hline
Snap to Grid & Number (in minutes) & Settings.Toolbar.SnapToGrid.Default \\
\hline
Auto Scheduler & Number (in minutes) & Settings.AutoScheduling. \\
Break Time & & MinOpenTime.Default\\
\hline
Auto Scheduler & Number (in minutes) & Settings.AutoScheduling. \\
Min Event Time & & MinTime.Default\\
\hline
Auto Scheduler & Number (in minutes) & Settings.AutoScheduling. \\
Max Event Time & & MaxTime.Default\\
\hline
Language & Drop Down Menu with all & Settings.Language.Default \\
& supported languages as options & \\
\hline
Notifications & Drop Down with following choices & Settings.Events.Notifications.Default \\
& - Email & Default\\
& - Text & \\
& - Banner & \\
& - Pop-up & \\
& - None & \\
\hline
Notification Time & Number (in minutes) & Settings.Events.Notifications. \\
Before Event & & Time.Default \\
\hline
Event Duration & Number (in minutes) & Settings.Events.Duration.Default \\
\hline
Location & Text Field with Suggestions & Settings.Events.Location.Default \\
& based on other event locations & \\
\hline
\end{longtable}
\end{center}
The constraints specified in the Settings.AutoScheduling.* Requirements will be checked while the user is entering the form and if the constraints are not met, the user will be unable to save their changes.
\\\\
Note that the Settings.AutoScheduling.MinOpenTime Requirement was merged with the Settings.AutoScheduling.Breaks Requirement since they represent the same thing.
